# CSS Gradient Generator

Live Project: [CSS Gradient Generator](https://agrawalaman02.github.io/CSS-Gradient-Generator-JsProject/)

This project is a CSS Gradient Generator that allows users to generate and copy linear gradients with ease. 

## Inspiration and Learning

This project was inspired by and created with the help of **Technical Thapa**. However, I made some modifications to enhance the functionality and design:
- The button color now changes dynamically when clicked.
- The footer and the CSS styling were customized by me.

## Planned Future Enhancements

Here are some improvements and new features I plan to add in the future:

- [ ] **Multiple Gradient Directions:** Allow users to choose different gradient directions (e.g., to right, to bottom, to top left). This can be added as a dropdown or a series of buttons.
- [ ] **Copy Feedback:** Provide feedback when the CSS code is copied, such as a tooltip or a temporary message indicating "Copied to clipboard!"
- [ ] **History of Generated Gradients:** Maintain a history of the last few generated gradients, allowing users to revert to previous choices if needed.
- [ ] **Save Option:** Allow users to save their gradient to a list or download it as a small CSS file for later use.
- [ ] **Improved Button Styles:** The buttons currently change size on hover, which might be jarring. Consider adding a more subtle effect, like a change in box shadow or border color instead.
- [ ] **Gradient Preview:** Add a small preview box showing the selected gradient independently of the entire background. This will allow users to see the gradient without it being influenced by other elements on the page.

## How to Use

Simply visit the [live project link](https://agrawalaman02.github.io/CSS-Gradient-Generator-JsProject/), choose your colors, and click to copy the generated CSS code to your clipboard.
